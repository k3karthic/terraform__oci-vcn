# Terraform - Create a Virtual Cloud Network in the Oracle Cloud
Create a Virtual Cloud Network in Oracle Cloud which will serve as the default VCN for all future deployments.

Terraform script for deploying a server in the [Oracle Cloud Always Free](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/#always-free) tier can be found at [https://github.com/k3karthic/terraform__oci-instance-1](https://github.com/k3karthic/terraform__oci-instance-1).

## Input Variables

Create a file to store the input variables using the sample file `india.tfvars.sample`. The file should be called `india.tfvars` or edit `bin/plan.sh` with the appropriate file name.

## Deployment

### Step 1

Create a Terraform plan by running plan.sh; the script will read input variables from the file india.tfvars

```
./bin/plan.sh
```

To avoid fetching the latest state of resources from OCI, run the following command

```
./bin/plan.sh --refresh=false
```

### Step 2

Review the generated plan

```
./bin/view.sh
```

### Step 3

Run the verified plan

```
./bin/apply.sh
```

## Encryption

Sensitive files like the input variables (india.tfvars) and Terraform state files are encrypted before being stored in the repository.

Use the following command to decrypt the files after cloning the repository,

```
./bin/decrypt.sh
```

Use the following command after running terraform to update the encrypted files,

```
./bin/encrypt.sh <gpg key id>
```
